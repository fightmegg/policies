6. **Third Party Clients**

   LoL is a game or skill, and therefore the outcome of matches solely lies on the players. (exception to this will be technical faults with the League of Legends client and will result in anything up to a re-match).

   Any user involved in cheating or match fixing will immediately be banned from the platform

8. **Gambling Prohibition**

   FightMe is not a platform that in any way facilitates or encourages Gambling.
   The platform is purely for competitive play and betting on FM games is strictly prohibited
   Any user involved in gambling on FM games in a manner compromising the integrity of the platform will be immediately banned from the platform.

9. **Good Conduct**

   Fightme expects all platform users to behave in a professional manner. Given this is a platform designed to promote and develop eSports, we expect players & teams to be mindful of their behaviour.
   Given the above, Fightme has put together a code of conduct that we expect all users to follow  
   FM reserves the right to refuse service to users if poor conduct is consistently demonstrated
