<!-- Privacy, FightMe -->

# Welcome!

Privacy and online safety are extremely important to FightMe. We offer a platform for aspiring eSports players to test their skills. We collect data about our users when they use our platform. This privacy policy describes how we collect, use and disclose Data.

In this privacy policy, we sometimes refer to “**You**”. “You” may be a visitor to one of our websites, a user of one or more of our Services (“**User**”). We’ll do our best to clarify who we are referring to at various points in the policy. If You disagree with the practices described in this policy, You should (a) take the necessary steps to remove cookies from Your computer after leaving our website, and (b) discontinue your use of our Services. Finally, we have also put together a [Cookie Policy](https://github.com/fightmegg/policies/blob/master/cookie-policy.md) that describes in detail how we use cookies and similar technologies.

## 1. Overview

The Data we collect depends on how our Services are used. Sometimes we receive Data directly, such as when a FightMe account is created, or we receive an email. Other times, we get Data by recording interactions with our Services, for example, cookies. We also get Data from third parties, like our identity verification services. The collection of and use of data is essential for our ability to provide our Services, and to help keep the Services safe.

Please note that our third parties will have their own privacy policies and by using the full FightMe suite of features, you will have at some point agreed to theirs.

## 2. Data We Collect

a. **Personal Data**: We call Data that identifies, or that could reasonably be used to identify You as an individual, “**Personal Data**”.

The Personal Data that we may collect includes:

- Contact details, name and email address only.

b. **Other Data**: We call Data other than Personal Data "**Other Data**". We collect Other Data through a variety of sources. One of our sources for Other Data is cookies and other technologies that record Data about the use of our website. Other Data that we may collect include:

**b. Other Data**: We may use Other Data for a range of different purposes, provided we comply with applicable law. In some countries (for example, European Economic Area countries), local legal regimes may require us to treat some or all of Other Data as “personal data” under applicable data protection laws. Where this is the case, we will process Other Data only for the same purposes as Personal Data under this privacy policy.
